    "This project will have you use <a href=\"http://tweepy.readthedocs.io/en/v3.5.0/\">Tweepy</a> (a Python library to access the Twitter API) and <a href=\"https://github.com/tumblr/pytumblr\">pytumblr</a> (a Python library to access the Tumblr API). This project will require a Tumblr and Twitter account. If you do not have one or do not wish to make one it is recommended to work with someone who does.\n",

    "It is nearly common knowledge that companies and governments buy and sell user data. However, it is not as well known the magnitude to which to these groups collect data.

    "Users divulge personal data when signing up for accounts, but they can also be giving information away without being conscious of it. Companies can identify or partially identify users through their device fingerprints, with no need for an account being created or cookies being used. Device fingerprints are comprised of the device being used, its operating system, the browser, the browser version, and browser plugins among other things.\n",
